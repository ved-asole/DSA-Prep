# Return Nth to Last

Implement and algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

### Example 1:

    Input:
    5
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    2
    
    Output : 
    4

    Explanation :
    If we go to 2nd last elemnt it's 4.

## Your Task:
- You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getNthLast() which takes the LinkedList `ll` and location `n`.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Sum Lists

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

### Example 1:

    Input:
    list1 = 7 -> 1 -> 6
    list2 =  5 -> 9 -> 2
    
    Output : 
    2 -> 1 -> 9

    Explanation :
    1st number = 617
    2nd number = 295
    Sum = 912

## Your Task:
- You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumLists() which takes the LinkedList `llA` and LinkedList `llB`.

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Find Sum of Diagonal Elements of a 2D Array

Write a function called sumDiagonalElements that takes an 2D array and calculates the sum of diagonal elements.

### Example 1:

    Input:
    3
    3
    {{1,2,3},{4,5,6},{7,8,9}}
    
    Output : 
    15

    Explanation :
    Diagonal elements are 1, 5, 9. Sum of these elements is 15.

## Your Task:
- You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sumDiagonalElements() which takes the 2D array arr[] and returns the sum of diagonal elements.

### Expected Time Complexity: 
O(n), where n is the length of each row in the array.

### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

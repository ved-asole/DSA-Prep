# Permutation

You are given two integer arrays. Write a program to check if they are permutation of each other.

### Example 1:

    Input:
    5
    1,2,3,4,5
    5,1,2,3,4
    
    Output : 
    true
    
    Explanation :
    5,1,2,3,4 is a permutation of 1,2,3,4,5 
    as all elements of 1,2,3,4,5 are present in 5,1,2,3,4 and vice-versa.

## Your Task:
- You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function permutation() which takes 2 arrays array1[] and array2[].

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

# Remove duplicates from a sorted array - Leetcode 26

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example 1:

    Input:
    3
    1, 1, 2
    
    Output : 
    2

    Explanation :
    The count of unique elements in the array is 2 i.e. 1 and 2.

## Your Task:
- You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function removeDuplicates() which takes the array nums[].

### Expected Time Complexity: O(n^2)
### Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
